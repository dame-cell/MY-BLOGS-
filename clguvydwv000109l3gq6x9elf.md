hello and welcome to my profile :)

If you are reading this, I want to thank you for giving your precious time for reading this blog.

Just started writing on HASHNODE and I’m excited for sharing my journey with you guys.

## **A LITTLE ABOUT ME:**

I love AI, Computer Science and space. Although Sometimes I have a love-and-hate relationship with maths.

## **MY GOAL IS TO DOCUMENT MY JOURNEY AND SHARE MY LEARNING :**

I won’t lie, but I love writing about what I love! I mean,

I'm a beginner so I will try blogging once a week and will increase posting more as I get better :)

I’m learning and doing what I love, and I might as well write about it and share my journey.

# **MY INSPIRATION:**

**ANDREJ KARPATHY IS ONE OF MY BIGGEST INSPIRATIONS. HE’S MY HERO:)**

**BIG FAN OF OPEN AI AS WELL, I STILL REMEMBER WHEN I SAW 5 AI BOTS WINNING AGAINST 5 PROFESSIONAL DOTA PLAYERS.**
